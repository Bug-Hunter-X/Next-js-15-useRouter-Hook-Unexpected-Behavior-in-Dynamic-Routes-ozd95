# Next.js 15 useRouter Hook Unexpected Behavior in Dynamic Routes

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior or error encountered when using the `useRouter` hook in Next.js 15, specifically within dynamic routes or after navigation events.  The issue might manifest as incorrect route state, unexpected re-renders, or even runtime errors.

## Description of the Problem:

The `useRouter` hook, while generally reliable, can exhibit unusual behavior under certain conditions in Next.js 15.  For instance, when navigating to a dynamic route, the initial route parameters might be incorrect, or subsequent navigation might not update the router state as expected.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the development server using `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to the `/about` page.
5. Observe the behavior of the `useRouter` hook (console logs might help illustrate the issue).
6. Click the 'Back to Home' button to navigate back. 
7. Observe the behavior of the `useRouter` hook.  The issue might appear inconsistent and depend on the specific navigation paths.

## Potential Causes:

* **Asynchronous Operations:**  The issue may be linked to the asynchronous nature of Next.js routing. If the `useRouter` hook is accessed before the routing process is complete, the state might be inaccurate.
* **Data Fetching:**  If data fetching or other asynchronous operations are involved, the timing of access to the `useRouter` hook becomes crucial, and race conditions could potentially occur.
* **Dynamic Routes:** The combination of dynamic routes and the `useRouter` hook can be a point of complexity, increasing the potential for issues.

## Proposed Solution (if found):

The `solutionContent.js` file may propose a resolution, involving techniques like:

* **`useEffect` hook:** Using `useEffect` with a cleanup function to control access to the router.
* **Conditional Rendering:** Implementing conditional rendering to prevent access to the router before the navigation is fully resolved.
* **Explicit State Management:** Employing a more explicit state management solution, such as Redux or Zustand, to handle the routing state.
